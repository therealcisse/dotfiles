# Sadly, this isn't compatible with the udevmon.service; if you try to test it:
#
#       sudo xkeysnail ~/.config/xkeysnail.py
#
# it will die with:
#
#       IOError when grabbing device. Maybe, another xkeysnail instance is running?
#
# To see it working, first do:
#
#       systemctl stop udevmon
#
# Or specify a `--device` explicitly:
#
#       sudo xkeysnail ~/.config/xkeysnail.py --devices /dev/input/event18
#
# ie. the cloned virtual device exposed by Interception tools:
#
#       https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/tools
#
# Some annoyances with this solution:
#
# -   xkeysnail may consider the input device to be disconnected on waking from
#     sleep (eg. see: https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/caps2esc,
#     "It resets any time a device change happens (bluetooth, usb, any) or the
#     laptop lid is closed or when logging off and needs to be re-executed.")
# -   Have to jump through hoops because of need to run as root.
# -   A number of combinrations don't seem to work.
# -   Python dependency graph.
